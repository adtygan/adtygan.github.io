  <title>Another Quarto Migration Guide for fastpages Users</title>
  <link>https://adtygan.github.io/posts/quarto-migration.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For more than four years, I used <a href="https://fastpages.fast.ai/">fastpages</a> for my personal site, <a href="https://sayak.dev">sayak.dev</a>, because it offered a really easy way to do blogging. When its creator, Hamel, <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastpages-deprecating-fastpages-in-favor-of-quarto/99095">posted</a> about its deprecation in favor of Quarto, I was anxious. Migrations always make me anxious. But I still continued with fastpages anyway.</p>
<p>But entering into this year, I decided to finally switch to Quarto for apparently no specific reason. I think I just wanted a fresh look for my website but didn‚Äôt want something too fancy. Quarto provides a perfect balance between simplicity and visual aesthetics. So, I knew I would use Quarto eventually I migrate from fastpages.</p>
<p>Hamel provides an excellent Quarto migration guide for fastpages users <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/blogging.html">here</a>. However, I had to take care of a few additional things to make it all work and successfully migrate sayak.dev to Quarto. In this post, I want to provide a detailed account of what I did and some personal preferential bits in the hope that it will be beneficial for someone else. Let‚Äôs get started üí´</p>
<section id="bit-0-go-through-the-original-migration-guide" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-0-go-through-the-original-migration-guide">Bit 0: Go through the original migration guide</h3>
<p>This post assumes that you‚Äôre here because you‚Äôre migrating your fastpages website to Quarto. So, it‚Äôs a must that you first read <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/blogging.html">Hamel‚Äôs migration guide</a> in detail.</p>
</section>
<section id="bit-1-install-nbdev-from-source" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-1-install-nbdev-from-source">Bit 1: Install <code>nbdev</code> from source</h3>
<p>While running the <code>nbdev_migrate --path posts</code> step, you might encounter compatibility problems. This is, luckily, easily mitigated by installing <code>nbdev</code> from source:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">pip</span> install git+https://github.com/fastai/nbdev</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="bit-2-use-a-separate-repository-for-dev" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-2-use-a-separate-repository-for-dev">Bit 2: Use a separate repository for dev</h3>
<p>I found it it‚Äôs better and more convenient to use a separate repository while doing the initial developments related to the migration. For example, my website code is hosted at https://github.com/sayakpaul/portfolio/, but I maintained another repository during the initial development.</p>
<p>This especially comes in handy for setting up the GitHub Actions, previewing the site with GitHub Pages, etc. This way, you can also ensure that everything looks hunky-dory before you move the contents to the actual serving repository (‚Äúportfolio‚Äù in my case).</p>
</section>
<section id="bit-3-connect-with-github-actions-and-pages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-3-connect-with-github-actions-and-pages">Bit 3: Connect with GitHub Actions and Pages</h3>
<p>Most of us (if not all) want to automate the website publishing process after a change is pushed to the serving repository. So, we should definitely set up a workflow that does this for us. Refer to the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action">official Quarto documentation</a> to use the recommended worflow file. It covers most use cases and it worked like a charm in my case. I didn‚Äôt have to touch a single thing in the workflow. Refer <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#source-branch">here</a> for connecting your site with GitHub Pages.</p>
</section>
<section id="bit-4-pay-attention-to-branch-names" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-4-pay-attention-to-branch-names">Bit 4: Pay attention to branch names</h3>
<p>If you used another repository as suggested in ‚ÄúBit 2‚Äù, be careful about the branch names when moving the contents over to the actual repository. You need to configure a repository branch name in the following places, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The publishing <a href="https://github.com/sayakpaul/portfolio/blob/b51a1d390c26d3bfef49e40c5723a30f5b6ee9f0/.github/workflows/publish.yml#L4">worfkflow</a></li>
<li>The ‚Äú_quarto.yml‚Äù <a href="https://github.com/sayakpaul/portfolio/blob/b51a1d390c26d3bfef49e40c5723a30f5b6ee9f0/_quarto.yml#L23">configuration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is important to note because fastpages defaults to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù while recent GitHub repositories default to ‚Äúmain‚Äù.</p>
</section>
<section id="bit-5-careful-copying" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-5-careful-copying">Bit 5: Careful copying</h3>
<p><em>(Only applicable if you used another repository as per ‚ÄúBit 2‚Äù)</em></p>
<p>When you‚Äôre satisfied with the migrated content, you may wish to copy over all the elements in the original repository. Some things I found to be useful to keep in mind while performing this step (assuming both the backup and original repositories are locally cloned):</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear out the original repository contents, first: <code>rm -rf * .gitignore .github</code>. This will remove all the files and folders along with the <code>.gitignore</code> file. You can add any other hidden files to the mix as needed. But don‚Äôt accidentally delete the <code>.git</code> file.</li>
<li>Copy over the contents from your backup repository: <code>cp -r backup_repo/* original_repo/ &amp;&amp; cp -r backup_repo/.github original_repo/</code>. Finally, copy the <code>.gitignore</code> file: <code>cp backup_repo/.gitignore original_repo/</code>. You can copy any additional hidden file as needed, but not the <code>.git</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that this step is slightly involved and can potentially be made simpler.</p>
</section>
<section id="bit-6-configuring-a-custom-domain" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bit-6-configuring-a-custom-domain">Bit 6: Configuring a custom domain</h3>
<p><em>(Only applicable if you‚Äôre serving from a custom domain)</em></p>
<p>I struggled with this step a little. After setting up the CNAME on my repository <a href="https://github.com/sayakpaul/portfolio/blob/master/CNAME">here</a> and configuring the GitHub Pages section as shown <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/sayakpaul/sample-datasets/blob/main/github_pages_sayak.png">here</a>, my site was not getting rendered at ‚Äúsayak.dev‚Äù, yielding 404 errors. After some Google searches, I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3249#discussioncomment-4090518">this thread</a>, and it solved the problem!</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs it! I found the Quarto resources to be really self-sufficient and the migration process was way smoother than expected, thanks to the amazing resources.</p>
