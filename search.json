It will allow me to query locally stored images using text and this is amazing because I can dump all my images in one folder and be very hopeful that I will be able to find it later. But folders don’t remain the same. Images get added or deleted and I need to keep track of these changes."

    "section": "Enter fswatch",
    "text": "Enter fswatch\nThis is where fswatch comes in clutch. It’s a tool that allows monitoring a folder for changes. And in this post, I want to cover a general recipe that allows for detecting file additions and deletions in a folder.\nLet’s call the script file-monitor.sh. It monitors the folder path ~/Vault and tracks files with extensions .jpg, .jpeg and .png. Both the folder path and file extensions tracked are easy to modify for different scenarios. Below is the code:\nFOLDER=~/Vault\n\n# Define a function to get state of directory\nget_state() {\n  find $FOLDER -type f \\( -iname \"*.jpg\" -o -iname \"*.jpeg\" -o -iname \"*.png\" \\)\n}\n\n# Initialize previous_state with state of directory\nprevious_state=$(get_state)\n\n# Monitor the ~/Vault directory for changes\nfswatch -0 -o $FOLDER | while read -d \"\" event; do\n  # For each event, list current state of directory \n  current_state=$(get_state)\n  # Diff current state with previous state\n  diff &lt;(echo \"$previous_state\") &lt;(echo \"$current_state\") | while read line; do\n    if [[ $line == \"&gt;\"* ]]; then\n      echo \"Added: ${line:2}\"\n    elif [[ $line == \"&lt;\"* && ! -z \"${line:2}\" ]]; then\n      echo \"Deleted: ${line:2}\"\n    fi\n  done\n  previous_state=$current_state\ndone\nThe code works by comparing the current state of the folder with its previous state. This allows it to detect file additions and deletions. After starting the script with bash file-monitor.sh, I added 2 images and renamed 1 exising image. Here is the output it produces:\nAdded: /Users/aditya/Vault/Orange Boat.jpg\nAdded: /Users/aditya/Vault/Futuristic Red.jpg\nDeleted: /Users/aditya/Vault/Orange Boat.jpg\nAdded: /Users/aditya/Vault/Orange Boat Illustration.jpg\nAs you can see, the script handles renaming as a combination of deletion and addition. This is a limitation of the chosen approach. A fix that I haven’t explored involves the following: When a Deletion + Addition pair is detected, check if the file count remains same before and after the pair of operations. If so, it is a Rename operation."
