Greetings ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya, an AI practitioner and tinkerer. I recently graduated 
  from the National University of Singapore where I was advised by 
  [Prof. Lee Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/), and worked
 on improving text-to-image retrieval systems for product matching.

I'm deeply passionate about **Human Centered AI** and believe in an exciting future
 where AI increasingly augments human creativity. I'll be using this space to document
 the interesting projects I cook up.
