Greetings ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya, an AI practitioner and tinkerer. I recently graduated 
from the National University of Singapore where I was advised by 
[Prof. Lee Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/), and worked
on improving text-to-image retrieval systems for product matching.

I'm deeply passionate about **Human Centered AI** and believe in an exciting future
where AI increasingly augments human creativity. I'll be using this space to document
the interesting projects I cook up.

The structure of this website is inspired by [Sayak's site](https://sayak.dev)
